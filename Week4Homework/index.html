        <p> Signed over in 1888 by president Grover Cleveland, Point Defiance Park has a little bit for everybody. There is a beautiful beach with a great view of Mount Ranier, multiple playgrounds for the little ones, and dense old growth trees.  If you're ever in the South Sound, Point Defiance is a must-see!</p>

      <h3> My Personal Experience</h3>
      <p>2 Years ago I moved to Washington State from southern California, and I was scared of leaving the densely populated area i grew up in. There was so much to do, and so much to see, but point Defiance has offered me a different perspective, as there is always something to do there. I have 3 kids and we have explored up and down this park and have yet to get bored of it's attractions.</p>
